# Internship Tasks – CodeVeda Technologies
This repository contains core machine learning tasks completed during my internship at **CodeVeda Technologies**, focused on supervised learning fundamentals and data preprocessing.
## Contents:
1. **DataPreprocessing.ipynb**  
   Covers essential steps for preparing data for machine learning, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and train-test splitting.
2. **KNN_classifier.ipynb**  
   Implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm. Includes training, accuracy evaluation, confusion matrix, and visualization of classification performance.
3. **LinearRegression.ipynb**  
   Implementation of a basic linear regression model for predicting continuous outcomes. Includes model fitting, performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R², and visualization of the regression line.
## Technologies Used:
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
